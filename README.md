# No Loitering!!

A simple plugin to ~~forcibly evict~~ gently remove guests when their cash on hand falls below a certain threshold.

Most effective in pay-for-entry parks or pay-per-ride parks that don't have the ATM.

## How to use

Configuration should be pretty straightforward. If "require security guard intervention" is _not_ checked, guests will automatically decide of their own free will to immediately leave when they fall below your threshold.
